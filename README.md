Setup:
The Nicla Vision Arduino board runs software on openMV,

Once openMV is downloaded and in usable condition load the code in the Repo onto it. Make sure that the board is connected to power and ground, the data wire should go into the motor 
driver green data wire, all black wires are ground. There should be a Dry run switch inbetween the data wire and the motor so that the pump can be toggled on or off if needed. The external battery is connected to the motor drivers ground and Vin port, the Vout should be connected to the pump itself. After all the connections are 
setup the camera is ready to detect faces and then activate the pump accordingly.
